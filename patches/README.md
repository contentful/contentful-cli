## bfj

Recently, [bfj](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bfj) added [jsonpath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath) matching. This project has no need for that functionality at this time. The jsonpath module is incompatible with [pkg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg) (see [jsonpath/issues/96](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath/issues/96)), unless the browserified version is used.

This patch tells bfj to use the browserified jsonpath version, ensuring compatibility with pkg.
