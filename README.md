[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

## :cloud: Installation

Using [npm](http://npmjs.org):

``` sh
npm install -g contentful-cli
```

Using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):
``` sh
yarn global add contentful-cli
```

Please note that for the non standalone versions you need node `=> v8` to use the CLI.

## :hand: Usage

Use the `--help` parameter to display the help section for CLI tool or combined with a specific command to get the help section for that command.

```sh
contentful --help
# or
contentful space --help
```

### Enable bash-completion

To enable bash-completion for available commands use the `completion` command and concat the generated script to your .bashrc or .bash_profile.

```sh
contentful completion
```

## Using the CLI tool with a proxy

You can save the proxy configuration in your `.contentfulrc.json` via:

```sh
contentful config add --proxy user:auth@host:port
```

We also respect the `http(s)_proxy` environment variables:

```sh
https_proxy=user:auth@host:port contentful
```

When multiple proxy configurations exists, precedence is taken in this form:

1. `http_proxy` takes precedence over `.contentfulrc.json`
2. `https_proxy` takes precedence over `.contentfulrc.json`
2. `https_proxy` takes precedence over `http_proxy`


## :rescue_worker_helmet: Troubleshooting

* Unable to connect to Contentful through your Proxy? Try settings `rawProxy: true` in your `.contentfulrc.json` via:

```sh
contentful config add --raw-proxy
```

## :books: Documentation

More detailed documentation for every command can be found in the [docs section](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli/tree/master/docs).

## :hammer_and_wrench: Development

After installing the dependencies, there is a trick to get your version of the CLI tool available globally on your system:
```sh
npm link
```

This may collide with your already globally installed Contentful CLI. Make sure to remove that one first.

## :robot: Testing

### Integration Tests

:warning: Environment variables should be set:

```
CLI_E2E_CMA_TOKEN = <cma_auth_token>
CLI_E2E_ORG_ID = <organization_id>
```

#### npm:
```sh
npm run test:integration
```
