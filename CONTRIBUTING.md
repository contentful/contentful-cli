We appreciate any community contributions to this project, whether in the form of issues or Pull Requests.

This document outlines the we'd like you to follow in terms of commit messages and code style.

It also explains what to do in case you want to setup the project locally and run tests.

# Setup

Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install all necessary dependencies. When running `npm install` or `yarn` locally, `dist` is not compiled.

All necessary dependencies are installed under `node_modules` and any necessary tools can be accessed via npm scripts. There is no need to install anything globally.

# Code style

This project uses [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard). Install a relevant editor plugin if you'd like.

Everywhere where it isn't applicable, follow a style similar to the existing code.

# Commit messages and issues

This project uses the [Angular JS Commit Message Conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit), via semantic-release. See the semantic-release [Default Commit Message Format](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#default-commit-message-format) section for more details.

**TLDR;**

- feat (feature) (e.g. `feat(scope): Implement new feature`)
- fix (bug fix) (e.g. `fix(scope): Fix a bug`)
- docs (documentation) (e.g. `docs(scope): Add documentation`)
- style (formatting, missing semi colons, â€¦) (e.g. `style(scope): Format code`)
- refactor (e.g: `refactor(scope): Refactor feature`)
- test (when adding missing tests) (e.g. `feat(scope): Add missing test`)
- chore (maintain) (e.g. `chore(scope): Maintain stuff`)

**Note:** scope is optional, if there is not scope you can get rid of the parentheses

# Running tests

## Unit tests

*Note: at the time of writing, the unit tests depend on the environment variables the integration tests use (see next heading below). Therefore please ensure they're set before executing the tests.*

Simply run:

```sh
# runs Node.js unit tests without coverage.
npm run test:unit

# Run all unit tests
npm run test:unit:watch

# Or run specific tests
npx jest test/unit/cmds/* --watch
```

See [jest](https://jestjs.io/) documentation for more details about running tests and optional flags.


## Integration tests

To run integration tests locally, [talkback](https://github.com/ijpiantanida/talkback) is used as a proxy to record and playback http requests

1. Prepare build in prep for integration tests
```sh
npm run build:standalone
```

1. In another terminal shell run your preferred tests
```sh
# Ensure environment variables are set to for the Ecosystem Integration Test Org (`Contentful - Ecosystem (for integration test org)` in password vault)
export CONTENTFUL_INTEGRATION_TEST_CMA_TOKEN='<cma_auth_token>'
export CLI_E2E_ORG_ID='<organization_id>'

# Run all integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Or run specific tests
npm run talkback-proxy
npx jest test/integration/cmds/space/* --watch
```

## Updating Snapshots

You might need to update snapshots and it's challenging with the recordings.

Tip: run tests without recordings to update the snapshots.

```
npx jest test/integration/cmds/<path to the affected test file> --updateSnapshot
```

This project has unit and integration tests. Both of these run on both Node.js and Browser environments.

Both of these test environments are setup to deal with Babel and code transpiling, so there's no need to worry about that

# Other tasks

- `npm run build:standalone` build standalone binary version
